    <p class="text-gray-700 font-normal leading-7 tracking-wider mb-4">
      1. MYTH – Poor mental health is not an issue for teenagers. They simply have mood swings
caused by hormonal fluctuations and act out because of desire of a want for attention. <br>
FACT – Teenagers do have mood swings but, but that does not mean that adolescents
experience mental-health problems.<br>
• Among age 10-15, suicide is the fifth most prevalent cause of death.<br>
• For adolescents age 15-19 it is the fourth biggest cause of death.<br>
• Half of all mental health conditions starts by the age 14. <br> <br>
1. MYTH—It is impossible to protect people from developing mental health conditions.<br>
FACT – There are various factors that can protect from developing mental health conditions.<br>
• Strengthen social and emotional skills. <br>
• Seeking help and support early on. <br>
• Developing supportive.<br>
• Loving.<br>
• Warm family relationships.<br>
• Having a positive environment.<br>
• Maintain Physical & Social health. <br> <br>
2. MYTH – A mental health condition is a sign of weakness. <br>
FACT – It has nothing to do with being weak. In fact recognizing the necessity to simply
accept help for a mental state condition needs nice strength and courageousness. Anyone
can develop a mental health condition. <br> <br>
3. MYTH – People with mental health conditions are tend to be violent and dangerous. <br>
FACT -- Only 3%-5% of violent acts can be attributes to individuals living with a serious
mental illness. <br> <br>
4. MYTH – we can’t help people with mental health conditions. <br>
FACT – Only 44% of the adults and 20% of the children and adolescents receives needed
treatment. So we can encourage people to take the needed treatment by: <br>
• Proving them information about mental health services. <br>
• Busting out the myths and sharing the facts regarding mental health. <br>
• Treating them with respect just like you want to be respected.
• Don’t labelling them as ‘crazy’ , ‘mad’ etc <br> <br>
5. MYTH – Mental health problems can’t affect me. <br>
FACT – Actually it is pretty common across the globe.

    <h5 class="text-cyan-900 text-4xl leading-wider  font-bold mb-2">DISCUSSING VARIOUS FACTORS OF MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL DISORDER</h5>
    <p class="text-gray-700 font-normal leading-7 tracking-wider mb-10">

      Is mental and behavioural disorder are caused by genetic reasons only? Or is it caused by
environmental factor only? The question has been around for years and the scientists have
now come to conclusion that it’s not genetic vs environment but actually genetic plus
environment factor. in other words, the interplay of biology with mental and
social elements.
science-based information of the Interaction between different factors will have a profound
effect on eliminating ignorance and to stop the abuse of people with these problems.<br><br>
• BIOLOGICAL FACTORS
Mental and behavioural disorders have been shown to be associated with disruptions of
neural communication within specific circuits.<br>
➢ In Schizophrenia,
Abnormalities in the maturation of neural circuits may produce detectable changes
in pathology at the cellular and gross tissue level that result in inappropriate or
maladaptive information processing.<br>
➢ In Depression,
however, it is possible that distinct anatomical abnormalities may not occur; rather,
risk of illness may be due to variations in the responsiveness of neural circuits (Berke
& Hyman 2000)<br><br>
➢ Psychoactive substance dependence
the result of maladaptive synaptic plasticity. In other words, drug-driven or
experience-driven alterations in synaptic connections can produce long-term
alterations in thinking, emotion and behaviour.
In parallel with progress in neuroscience has come progress in genetics. Almost all of the common
severe mental and behavioural disorders are associated with a significant genetic component of risk.
a genetic predisposition to develop a particular mental or behavioural disorder may manifest only in
people who also experience specific environmental stressors that elicit the pathology. Examples of
environmental factors could range from exposure to<br>
• psychoactive substances as a fetus<br>
• Malnutrition<br>
• Infections<br>
• Disrupted family environments<br>
• Isolation and trauma. Etc.<br>
• PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS<br>
One main finding throughout the 20th century that has shaped current understanding is the crucial
importance of relationships with parents or other caregivers during childhood. Regardless of the
specific cause, when children are deprived of nurture from their caregivers they are more likely to
develop mental and behavioural disorders, either during childhood or later in life. Evidence for this
finding comes from infants living in institutions that did not provide sufficient social stimulation.
psychological science has shown that certain types of mental and behavioural disorders, such as
anxiety and depression, can occur as the result of failing to cope adaptively to a stressful life event.
Generally the people who try to neglect their problems instead to talking about it and solving it are
more likely to develop anxiety and depression.<br><br>
• SOCIAL FACTORS
We will here discuss some of the factors like urbanization, poverty, technological change which<br><br>
account for mental and behavioural disorders.<br><br>
• Urbanization
The nature of modern urbanization may have deleterious consequences for mental
health through the influence of increased stressors and adverse life events, such as<br>
▪ overcrowded and polluted environments<br>
▪ poverty<br>
▪ dependence on a cash economy<br>
▪ high levels of violence<br>
▪ reduced social support (Desjarlais et al. 1995).<br>
In some areas, economic development is forcing increasing numbers of indigenous
peoples to migrate to urban areas in search of a viable livelihood. Usually, migration
does not bring improved social well-being; rather, it often results in high rates of
unemployment and squalid living conditions, exposing migrants to social stress and
increased risk of mental disorders because of the absence of supportive social
networks. Conflicts, wars and civil strife are thus associated with higher rates of
mental health problems.<br><br>
• So Rural is safe?
Well you might get that impression but is that really the case? The common
difficulties that account for mental and behavioural disorder in rural areas are :<br>
▪ Isolations<br>
▪ Lack of transport and communications<br>
▪ Limited educational opportunities<br>
▪ Limited economic opportunities<br>
▪ Limited access to metal health care sevices<br>
In fact, A recent study of suicide in the elderly in some urban and rural areas of
Hunan province, China, showed a higher suicide rate in rural areas (88.3 per 100
000) than in urban areas (24.4 per 100 000) (Xu et al. 2000).<br><br>
• Poverty
The relationship between mental health and poverty is multidimensional and
complexed poverty can be understood as the state of having insufficient
means, which may include the lack of social or educational resources. The poor and
the deprived have a higher prevalence of mental and behavioural disorders,
including substance use disorders. The associations
There is also evidence that the course of mental and behavioural disorders is
determined by the socioeconomic status of the individual. Even in rich countries,
poverty along with associated factors such as
▪ lack of insurance coverage,<br>
▪ lower educational level<br>
▪ unemployment<br>
▪ minority status in terms of race<br>
▪ ethnicity and language can create insurmountable barriers to care.
The treatment gap for most mental disorders is high, but in the poor population it is
indeed massive.<br><br>
• Racism
The available evidence indicates that people long targeted by racism are at heightened
risk for developing mental problems or experiencing a worsening of existing ones. You
know what’s funny? people who practise and perpetuate racism themselves are found
to have or to develop certain kinds of mental disorders.<br><br>
• Technological Change
another factor that has been associated with mental and behavioural development
chaos is Unusual rate and rapid technological change in the late 20th century. These
technological changes, and especially the communication revolution, provides
excellent opportunities for improved information and empowerment of users.
Telemedicine now makes it possible to provide treatment at a distance.
But do these advantages come with a downside? There is evidence that the media
exposure contributes to levels of violence, sexual behaviour and interest in
pornography, and that exposure to violent video games promotes aggressive
behaviour and so on aggressive tendencies (Dill & Dill 1998).<br><br>
• Social factor affects women more?
Rates of depression among rural women have been reported to be more than twice
those of general population estimates for women (Hauenstein & Boyd 1994).<br><br>
Across socioeconomic levels, the multiple roles that women fulfil in society put them
at greater risk of experiencing mental and behavioural disorders than others in the
community. Violence against women constitutes a major social and public
health problem, affecting women of all ages, cultural backgrounds, and income
levels.<br><br>
In addition to the pressures placed on women because of their expanding and often
conflicting roles, they face<br>
▪ Significant sex discrimination<br>
▪ Poverty,<br>
▪ Hunger,<br>
▪ Malnutrition,<br>
▪ Overwork and<br>
▪ Domestic and sexual violence. Etc. <br>
